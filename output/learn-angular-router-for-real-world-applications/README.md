Asciicasts for [Juri Strumpflohner](https://egghead.io/instructors/juri-strumpflohner)'s course, Learn Angular Router for Real World Applications on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io//courses/learn-angular-router-for-real-world-applications)

## Description
One of the fundamental concepts for building a successful large scale application is to break it down into smaller, potentially independent but mainly more easily controllable and maintainable parts. This starts at the component level, the module level and finally the application routing level. Routing is a core part of every application and should be definitely part of a developer’s toolbelt. 

This course will guide you step by step and help you get from the basic concepts of routing to mastering expert level topics. We will start learning how to setup and configure the router and how to define simple routes and child routes and best practices of how to organize them using the Routing Module pattern. You will learn about the supported URL types and its segments, how to define them and how to leverage RxJS Observables for subscribing to route updates. We will also talk about how to secure routes with various types of guards and about performance tuning with the router’s lazy loading and preloading capabilities.
